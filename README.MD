# Catalog App

Catalog App is a web application for jewerly crafts items.

  - Items grouped into catagories
  - Item modification authentication protected
  - Third party login authentication


### How to Execute the App

Catalog App uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

1.	Install Vagrant and VirtualBox
2.	Clone the fullstack-nanodegree-vm
3.	Launch the Vagrant VM (vagrant up)
4.	Write your Flask application locally in the vagrant/catalog directory (which will automatically be synced to /vagrant/catalog within the VM).
5.	Run your application within the VM (python /vagrant/catalog/application.py)
6.	Access and test your application by visiting http://localhost:8000 locally


And of course Catalog App itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.
